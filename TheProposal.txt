I. Thesis
    Artificial Intelligence is being utilized by many people to subsize their work, help them
    communicate with other people, and even to tutor them in some cases. But what if AI used other
    AI to do the same for its own purposes. Cases like AlphaGeometry, created by the AI lab
    DeepMind, show this to be potentially a fruitful approach. In their paper they claim to have used
    a language model to assist a deduction engine to solve Olympiad-level geometry problems. In
    my project I intend to show that large generative models can assist in creating and fine tuning
    smaller, rigid models to accomplish narrow tasks that the large model would be incapable of
    solving on its own.
II. Method
    First would be to do research into the potential novel and interesting problems that the
    models would be best used to solve. Some examples being utilizing a C++ physics engine to
    design virtual robots to achieve a goal or using already built software such as video games for
    the models to discover the best techniques to beat the game. The next step is to then decide on
    the best models to solve the problems. Potentially pairing things like Reinforcement Learning
    and a Large Language Model. The RL can be used as the small model to solve the narrow
    problem while the LLM can be used to analyze results and suggest changes to the RL model.
    Lastly reporting on the success or failure to reproduce the benefits of having a creative and rigid
    models working in tandem. This might include cases of attempting to do utilize just one model
    without the other in the loop to compare with both working in tandem.
III. Outcome
    The outcome of the project will be a program that includes a problem for the models to
    solve and the two models that will be tied into the project code. There will also be a formal
    report with information on my results and how to replicate every step taken in the project.
