## Figure out the problem (In progress)
    #C++ physics
        - What would this require?
            - Backend
                - User created objects
                - Physics
                - Maps
                - Object interactions
                - Lots of ibprofen
                - Goal states
                - Customability
            - Front end
                - UI
                - Graphics
                - Output of DATA
        - How to accomplish?
            - Backend
                - Good ol math
                - There is online libraries for game engines that accomplish this too
            - Front end
                - A library for all of this.
                - C++ has a graphics library to include (potentially)

    #A Video game
        - Pokemon Red
            - https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy
        - Pacman
        - 2048
        - https://osgameclones.com/ Got a few options here
            -Rogue likes might be good, has easily measureable states such as level, hp, enemies killed, ect. and randomized enviroments to force abstract policies
    #Basic Boring online DATA 
        - eww no
    #
    

## Figure out the models to use (NS)
    # RL and LLM
        - LLM: ChatGPT, Claude, or a local Llama 70B
        - RL: Gotta figure this out, maybe skitlearn will provide

## Build the problem (NS)
    # Gotta figure out the problem first

## Integerate the models (NS)
    # Gotta choose the models

## Record the data (NS)
    # Just me tweeking stuff
        - Using my own brain for tweeking the narrow model
    # Using random tweeks
        - Depending on the narrow model this might be an option
    # Using large model
        - Using the large model by itself to tweek stuff
    # Using both me and large model
        - Taking suggestions from the large model but tweeking them on my own judgement

## Write the report (NS)
    # Using LaTeX write formal report
        - Abstract
        - Intro
        - Method
            - Screen shots
        - Data Analysis
            - Take the recorded data and make graphs
        - Conclusion
            - Success or failure

## Submit the paper and project (NS)
- December 13th
